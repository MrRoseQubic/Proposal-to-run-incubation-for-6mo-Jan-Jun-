## **Decision options**

| Option | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0 | No — do not approve  |
| 1 | Yes — approve the $13,000/mo ($78,000 total budget) |

## **1\. TL;DR**

This proposals aims to run **Incubation Program for 6mo** reducing and restructuring its cost structure:

* Only 1 fixed team member  
* Reduced pool of suppliers just for legal and advisory support  
* Improved QA process via the creation of a community QA team  
* New RFPs  
* Financial and performance reporting as usual

Additionally, I will continue offering general support to:

* Community initiatives like projects, training, events…  
* Financial reporting  
* Strong support for Restructuring the Ambassadors program  
* Coordination with Core-tech, Marketing and AI Research workgroups

**2\. Incubation program (incl. Grants)**

Grants and Incubation programs have proven to be a fundamental tool to improve and expand Qubic usability. From tools like Lite Node or MM Snap to dApps like Nostromo or Qswap, incubation serves as a lever to accelerate Qubic adoption and as a gateway for community-led developments.

During the past year we improved several aspects of the program that reduced Qubic exposure to underperformance and financial risk, we improved transparency and communication, and we created the RPF process to tackle bigger projects. Now that the program is mature I aim to keep operating it and improving its operation with the following changes:

- **QA procedure:** Following SAFe/Agile principles established during the last periods, and continuing with the decentralization vision of Qubic, from now on:  
  -  All QAs will be executed from a functional perspective only (no code review, only features).  
  - Instead of an internal QA team, in order to validate adoption, all milestones will be validated with the community during a 2wk period. If, for any reason, QA is not executed properly, a pool of Qubic developers will be created to execute QA on a per project/hours basis (no fixed salaries). Rates will be public and aligned with Qubic standards. All community members are eligible to participate in the QA team as long as they can prove their skills.   
  - In the same way as with SC, QA costs will be covered by Incubation fund, as it is an intrinsic cost of all development projects  
  - Incubation will cover ONLY 1 SC audit per project. It is the responsibility of developers to assume the overrun in case of further reviews  
- **Submission procedure:** Jointly with the Marketing team, website and submission form will be updated to reflect the whole Incubation journey, FAQs, T\&C, deadlines etc. All information will be clearly included in the website  
- **Bounties:** In collaboration with Core-tech we will improve the bounties program to make it shareholders-led. This means we will coordinate SC shareholders to create their own bounties program using the same platform we use for wallet and Qubic infra bounties.  
- **RFPs:** I will continue working on the next RPFs , in collaboration with Core-tech, being the priority Oracles (USDT bridge, stablecoin and Perp DEX would follow depending on performance and price action). Prior to any Oracles RFP, it is considered we need further analysis on how to profitably run Oracles within Qubic. To solve this, we will conduct a Discovery analysis to identify the most suitable business model for Oracles in Qubic, which also will include a vendor and gap analysis.    
- **Advisory support:** As every major challenge, this one cannot be tackled alone either. I will count on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for specific assistance, who will also be paid on a per project/hourly basis if applicable (reducing fixed costs and maximizing efficiency). Advisors will depend on the project or issue we may face. There is no pool of SMEs.  
- **Legal support:** in order to be able to sign NDAs, agreements and receive invoices strictly related to Incubation, we’ll have a legal entity and a legal counsel to assist us in these matters. Likewise, they will also be paid on a per project/hourly basis.

## **3\. Roadmap**

This is not a per-project proposal, hence this is an illustrative roadmap of how initiatives will be prioritized. It must be considered that, given the majority of them have strong external dependencies, the roadmap may vary (which I will be updating regularly). Additionally, the daily operations of Incubation (new submissions, QAs, general management…), which are not included in this roadmap, may also impact the delivery of such initiatives.

| Initiative | Expected delivery |
| ----- | ----- |
| QA procedure | January-February for full implementation |
| Submission procedure | January |
| Discovery analysis (Oracles) | End February beginning March full report |
| Bounties | Fully dependant on shareholders, ideally March-April full implementation |
| RFPs | Once Vottun Bridge is working and the Discovery analysis (Oracles) is finalised we will explore further RFPs |

**3\. Budget Detail (USD)**

| Item | Amount per month | Nº months | Total | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | ----- | ----- |
| Team salaries | $6,000 | 6 | $36,000 | Fixed amount |
